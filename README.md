# The-Land
##### Note: I have not currently uploaded the servers code.

The land was a game that I worked on during the start of 2017.  I had only just over 1 year experience, so before you tell me 'This save system is dumb', or 'the servers are stupid and insecure', I already know and wouldnt build a program like this now days.

That said, I am still proud of this, despite its flaws as it was the first big project that I worked on without a tutorial to help start me off with the basic setting up render functions etc.

I started working on it in Jan of 2017 and worked on it for a few months before stopping this project due to the age old problem of programmers never finishing side projects.  This was about the time that I made my first Ludum Dare Game, with the confidence I had gained from this.

# Origin
The idea for The Land came from a small game I had designed a few years prior (before knowing how to write code).  I stumbled across this and was like 'Hey, I should write this properly' and then began creating it.

The original version had a few different features such as 'Battle Mode' Where enimies would spawn a lot more commonly so the player could earn money faster, but for some reason this never got added.

# Game Play
The aim of the game is to basically kill enimies by clicking them, buy new armour, weapons etc and collect drops to someday summon and defeat bosses for powerful drops.

When you start the game it generates a random world.  At the start was a town in which you live.  (Clicking the first door on the left takes you into your home).

In your home, you can click the computer and browse various web pages that mock real web pages, eg goggles.com.  There is a list of some websites, but some are discoverable that arent in this list.

You can interact with some of the people in the other homes and earn more money, or you can go out and kill enimies to get money.  Enimies don't spawn if you are in a town, as that is a safe zone.

# Credits
Most of the artwork, all the code and all the audio was created by me
A few sprites were created by my friend, who at the time of making the game, went by the name swiss.blue

# Fun Fact!
I just noticed that my profile pic is the origional ghost from The Land.
